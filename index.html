          <h2>Our Founder&#8217;s Story</h2>
          <p>
            Christy lives, breathes and loves real estate. As a Charlotte area
            local with more than a decade of full-time real estate experience,
            she has personally flipped and sold homes many years and has an eye
            for design, gets her kicks on market strategizing, and a nose for
            business like no other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her real estate team concentrates on helping clients achieve their
            dreams of home ownership in a fun, professional, and exciting way,
            as well as helping her clients sell their homes quickly with tools
            like unmatched photography, social media proficiency and marketing
            and powerful connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            She was cast for an episode of HGTV about flipping homes for profit,
            has been a long-time RE-MAX executive level club member, and seeks
            to delight and exceed her clients in every way. She was a platinum
            level earner in her days selling new homes and was named the Home
            Builders Association&#8217;s Rookie of the Year in 2009. She was
            featured on a nationally syndicated pod-cast on closing strategies
            the same year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christy resides in the Davidson, NC area with her husband and her
            four children.

          <h2>Rebekah Taylor&#8217;s Story</h2>
          <p>
            As a native of Charlotte, NC, Rebekah has been able to watch this
            beautiful city & state blossom right before her eyes. The convenient
            access to the coastline, 4-full seasons each year & the unique
            southern hospitality are just a few reasons the Taylor family of 5
            planted their roots in this great city. Rebekah and her husband are
            the proud parents of 3 children ranging in age from 4-17 yr old, so
            there is never a dull moment!
          </p>
          <p>
            Following school, Rebekah began her career in the dental field where
            she helped local dentists open, build and manage multiple dental
            practices. After spending 11 years in the dental field, Rebekah and
            her husband decided to pursue their entrepreneurial goals and open a
            juice & smoothie bar in the Charlotte market. While running the
            juice bar, Rebekah decided she wanted to begin investing in real
            estate, and it was love at first purchase! She enjoyed every part of
            the process and felt it was only fitting that she act on this
            passion by helping other people find their dream home or investment
            opportunity. Rebekah always sets the bar high to exceed the
            expectations of her clients and create an unforgettable real estate
            experience!
          </p>
          <p>
            Rebekah's most favorite part of being a realtor is getting to see
            the different styles of homes and meeting new people.

            from NY and she was amazing helping us look and find the perfect
            place. We then did everything after long distance. She went above
            and beyond helping with everything that would come up, even small
            things she didn't need to do. She has gone from our realtor to such
            an amazing friend and we couldn't ask for anything more!</q

            >As a first time home buyer, I was incredibly intimidated by the
            thought of all of the work that would go into buying my first home.
            I had followed Christy Bradshaw and Magnolia Group Reality, and
            after reaching out to them, I was quickly put in contact with
            Valerie Flynn, and I simply cannot express how satisfied I am with
            Valerie’s performance as a realtor. She stayed in constant
            communication with me throughout the entire process, she was patient
            when I was picky, and she consistently made an effort to find
            listings that she believed would be a good fit for me. In the end,
            she found a house that met my needs perfectly, and from the moment
            we toured it together, I knew it was supposed to be my home. Without
            her, my dream of owning a home wouldn’t have been made possible, and
            I truly value her hard work. I will always recommend Valerie to
            anyone I know who is on the journey of home ownership. I couldn’t be
            happier!</q
