As a Charlotte area local with more than a decade of full-time real estate experience, she has personally flipped and sold homes many years and has an eye for design, gets her kicks on market strategizing, and a nose for business like no other.</p>

          <p>She was cast for an episode of HGTV about flipping homes for profit, has been a long-time RE-MAX executive level club member, and seeks to delight and exceed her clients in every way. She was a platinum level earner in her days selling new homes and was named the Home Builders Association&#8217;s Rookie of the Year in 2009.

          <h2>Leigh Hurley&#8217;s Story</h2>
          <p>As a Native of Florida, I love to spend time at the beach – Jensen Beach, FL being my favorite. However, having spent the majority of my life between Charlottesville, VA and Arlington/Alexandria, VA I also enjoy hiking, traveling and spending quality time with my friends, family, husband and the most adorable poodle in the world, Chloe Poodles. I have a passion for interior design, which I enjoy as a hobby from time to time, occasionally with a glass (or two) of red wine! My secret talent is reading vanity license plates :) There is rarely one that goes unsolved before the light turns green! I graduated with a BA in Communications from George Mason University and a Masters degree from Gonzaga University. I am very excited to have joined the RE/MAX Leading Edge team! Relocating to Charlotte/Lake Norman has been an incredible experience and I look forward to helping others find their dream homes in this amazing town I am thrilled to now call home!</p>

          <q>Leigh helped us back in June find and close on our house.  We had come down on a weekend trip to look at houses in like a 24 hour span from NY and she was amazing helping us look and find the perfect place.  We then did everything after long distance.  She went above and beyond helping with everything that would come up, even small things she didn't need to do.  She has gone from our realtor to such an amazing friend and we couldn't ask for anything more!</q>

          <q>Christy is the consummate professional but also has the imagination to think outside the box. She strikes the perfect balance of collaboration while still providing her expertise and advice. Selling our home with Christy was a great experience, we highly recommend her and Magnolia.</q>

        <div class="mySlides2">
          <q>As a first time home buyer, I was incredibly intimidated by the thought of all of the work that would go into buying my first home. I had followed Christy Bradshaw and Magnolia Group Reality, and after reaching out to them, I was quickly put in contact with Valerie Flynn, and I simply cannot express how satisfied I am with Valerie’s performance as a realtor. She stayed in constant communication with me throughout the entire process, she was patient when I was picky, and she consistently made an effort to find listings that she believed would be a good fit for me. In the end, she found a house that met my needs perfectly, and from the moment we toured it together, I knew it was supposed to be my home. Without her, my dream of owning a home wouldn’t have been made possible, and I truly value her hard work. I will always recommend Valerie to anyone I know who is on the journey of home ownership. I couldn’t be happier!</q>

          <q>We have now bought and sold three houses with Christy! To say she was amazing is an understatement. She fights hard to make sure you have the best prices and is so knowledgeable and easy to communicate with! Her team is the best team!</q>
