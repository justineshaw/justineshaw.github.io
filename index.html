          <q>Ashley helped my husband and I find our first home! I can&#8217;t express enough how appreciative we were of her consistent communication, open availability, and patience with us. She truly listened to what we were looking for in our first dream home, and found us a home that fit that to a tee. Ashley made sure to keep us in the loop and always confirmed that we understood what was taking place. If we didn&#8217;t, she was more than willing to educate us. We highly recommend Ashley and will absolutely be referring her to our friends and family&#8230;</q>

          <q>Christy is the consummate professional but also has the imagination to think outside the box. She strikes the perfect balance of collaboration while still providing her expertise and advice. Selling our home with Christy was a great experience, we highly recommend her and Magnolia.</q>

          <q>As a first time home buyer, I was incredibly intimidated by the thought of all of the work that would go into buying my first home. I had followed Christy Bradshaw and Magnolia Group Reality, and after reaching out to them, I was quickly put in contact with Valerie Flynn, and I simply cannot express how satisfied I am with Valerie’s performance as a realtor. She stayed in constant communication with me throughout the entire process, she was patient when I was picky, and she consistently made an effort to find listings that she believed would be a good fit for me. In the end, she found a house that met my needs perfectly, and from the moment we toured it together, I knew it was supposed to be my home. Without her, my dream of owning a home wouldn’t have been made possible, and I truly value her hard work. I will always recommend Valerie to anyone I know who is on the journey of home ownership. I couldn’t be happier!</q>

          <q>Being a Realtor from Florida and having a family member move up to North Carolina was kind of an uneasy feeling because you want to help your family member as their Realtor. I did a lot of searches and I found the ideal realtor in Ashley Ferlauto. She went above and the beyond for not only my family but all of us involved. She has welcomed my sister-in-law into the community taught her about things in the new area and really went above and beyond what most Realtors do. She was a stellar human being with a heart of gold that goes the extra mile. If I ever move to North Carolina she will definitely be my realtor!</q>
